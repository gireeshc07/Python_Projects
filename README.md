# 📊 Project - 1: Students Marks List

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python

## 📈 Objectives
- Develop an interactive console-based system for students to access their marks securely.
- Implement nested conditional statements and loops to validate user inputs.
- Enhance user experience with clear prompts and error-handling mechanisms.

## 💡 Soft Skills
- **Problem-Solving:** Designed a structured input validation process to prevent incorrect data entry.
- **Logical Thinking:** Utilized nested if conditions and iterative loops for seamless user interaction.
- **User Interaction Management:** Ensured a smooth and guided experience with detailed prompts and feedback.
- **Attention to Detail:** Implemented conditions to handle multiple incorrect attempts and exit strategies.

## 🖥️ Technical Skills
- **Python Programming:** Applied core concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Input Validation:** Designed robust mechanisms to handle incorrect inputs efficiently.
- **User Authentication Logic:** Used conditional checks to verify student identity before displaying marks.
- **Control Flow Management:** Utilized `while` and `if-else` statements for structured execution.
